# Lil-Bill - Dollar Bill Classifier Mobile App

### Note: We are using the hotdog classifier app as our baseline.

# Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:
* nvm (optional) - https://www.codementor.io/mercurial/how-to-install-node-js-on-macos-sierra-mphz41ekk
* node - LTS version - 8.12.0 as of 10/25/18
* npm - version 6.4.1 as of 10/25/18
* python 2
* react-native
* XCode 9 or above

# Installation Steps

If you have nvm:
```
nvm install --lts
nvm use --lts
```
Note:  nvm installs BOTH node and npm.

Otherwise, install npm and the LTS version of node from the node.js website.

Now, we can install react-native

```
npm install -g react-native-cli
```

Now that we have installed what we need, we can train the machine learning model.
